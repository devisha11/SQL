/* Write a solution to report the shortest distance between any two points from the Point2D table. Round the distance to two decimal points. 
  
 The result format is in the following example. 
  
 Example 1: 
  
 Input:  
 Point2D table: 
 +----+----+ 
 | x  | y  | 
 +----+----+ 
 | -1 | -1 | 
 | 0  | 0  | 
 | -1 | -2 | 
 +----+----+ 
  
 Output:  
 +----------+ 
 | shortest | 
 +----------+ 
 | 1.00     | 
 +----------+ 
  
 Explanation: The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1, -1) to (-1, 2).  */ 
  
  
 SQL: 
 SELECT ROUND(MIN(SQRT(POW(b.x-a.x,2) + POW(b.y-a.y,2))), 2) AS Shortest  
 FROM coord a JOIN coord b 
 WHERE a.x!=b.x or a.y!=b.y;
