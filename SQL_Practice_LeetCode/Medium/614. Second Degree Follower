/*  Write a solution to report the second-degree users and the number of their followers. 
 Return the result table ordered by follower in alphabetical order. 
  
 The result format is in the following example. 
  
 Example 1: 
  
 Input:  
 Follow table: 
 +----------+----------+ 
 | followee | follower | 
 +----------+----------+ 
 | Alice    | Bob      | 
 | Bob      | Cena     | 
 | Bob      | Donald   | 
 | Donald   | Edward   | 
 +----------+----------+ 
  
 Output:  
 +----------+-----+ 
 | follower | num | 
 +----------+-----+ 
 | Bob      | 2   | 
 | Donald   | 1   | 
 +----------+-----+ 
  
 Explanation:  
 User Bob has 2 followers. Bob is a second-degree follower because he follows Alice, so we include him in the result table. 
 User Donald has 1 follower. Donald is a second-degree follower because he follows Bob, so we include him in the result table. 
 User Alice has 1 follower. Alice is not a second-degree follower because she does not follow anyone, so we don not include her in the result table.  */ 
  
  
 Code: 
 SELECT followee, COUNT(*) FROM follow 
 WHERE followee IN (SELECT follower FROM follow) 
 GROUP BY followee;
