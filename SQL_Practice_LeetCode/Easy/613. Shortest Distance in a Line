/* Find the shortest distance between any two points from the Point table. 
  
 The result format is in the following example. 
  
 Example 1: 
  
 Input:  
 Point table: 
 +----+ 
 | x  | 
 +----+ 
 | -1 | 
 | 0  | 
 | 2  | 
 +----+ 
  
 Output:  
 +----------+ 
 | shortest | 
 +----------+ 
 | 1        | 
 +----------+ 
  
 Explanation: The shortest distance is between points -1 and 0 which is |(-1) - 0| = 1.   */ 
  
  
 SQL: 
 SELECT MIN(b.x-a.x) AS shortest  
 FROM coord a JOIN coord b 
 ON a.x<b.x;
